# Lung Cancer Prediction - Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of **lung cancer** using real-world patient data. It involves **multiple regression analysis**, **correlation study**, and **data visualization** techniques to identify key risk factors and build a predictive model.

### 🎯 Project Aim

This project aims to create a **multiple regression model** to analyze the data and **predict the likelihood** of a patient having a higher or lower chance of developing lung cancer.  
The purpose is to identify **primary risk factors** for lung cancer and use them to create a **precise and accurate prediction model** to support early detection and prevention.

## 📂 Project Files

- **Lung Cancer Project.xlsx** – Contains:
  - Cleaned and structured data
  - Correlation matrix
  - Multiple linear regression analysis
  - Charts (Bar, Pie, Line)
  - Summary and interpretation of results
- **Lung Cancer Project.pdf** – A detailed report that includes the objective, methodology, findings, and conclusion.

## 📊 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Microsoft Excel** (for analysis and visualization)
- **Descriptive statistics** (mean, median, mode)
- **Correlation analysis** (Pearson’s correlation to find risk factor relationships)
- **Multiple Linear Regression** (to build a prediction model)
- **Data visualization** (charts and graphs for insights)

## 📈 Project Conclusion

The study successfully met its objective. It identified key variables that influence lung cancer risk and developed a regression-based model that can help in early prediction.  
The analysis supports the use of statistical modeling in healthcare to guide preventive strategies and improve patient outcomes.

## 📚 Educational Context

This project was completed as part of the **B.Sc. Mathematics** curriculum at **Stella Maris College, Chennai**.
